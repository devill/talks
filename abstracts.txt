BIO
===

Rafael is a Lead Developer at Budapest-based Emarsys and popular speaker in the Hungarian software community.
As a founding member of Emarsys CraftLab - the dedicated coaching team of Emarsys - he has thought university
courses and lectured at numerous conferences. His passion for short feedback loops drove him to create Lean Poker,
a workshop where developers have the opportunity to experiment with continuous delivery in an artificial environment.


Lean Poker
==========


Minimum viable team: testing your ideas alone
==============================================

So you have an idea for a great application, but not much money nor friends to help out. You already asked people
if they would be interested, and they were really supportive, but when it comes to coding you are all alone. For
a developer, who is used to working in a team, it can be really demanding to go through with even a moderately
sized project. You know how to be effective as a team, but the same practices seem to hold you back when you are alone.

In the last few years I started a number of projects alone and managed to build, deploy and validate (or invalidate)
them within weeks of starting the project, and all that as a hobby next to my day job. Taking a few of these projects
as examples, I will tell you what agile practices you should hang on to and what you should change or replace.


Clean persistence
=================

Separating the database layer from the rest of code has always been an important topic, yet more often than not
 web applications end up looking like huge wrappers around the database. Keeping your database related code
 nicely isolated is hard, and it's even harder with applications where most of the logic has to do with reading
 and writing data. We will look at common mistakes, testing, design patterns and polyglot persistence.

Free beer and immortality
=========================

If a politician promised free beer and immortality people would laugh at him. If he promises workplaces and cheap
natural gas for heating they applaud him. The ironic thing about this is that the free beer is way more realistic
than a workplace for everyone who wants to do manual labour. Immortality is not entirely impossible, but burning
fossil fuels mindlessly will definitely kill us pretty soon unless we stop. The key phrase here is "technological
singularity" and it's a lot closer then we care to believe. But how do we get there? How do we adapt our society?
Who is going to be the last person to work and what's going to be the last task he completes?


The most important concept in an innovation based society
=========================================================

Ever since computers became cheap humankind is on it's mission to automate everything. If your work is repetitive, 
and does not involve creativity there is good chance it is either already automated, or will be pretty soon. That also 
goes for certain parts of a more complex job. That is the reason developers write tools all the time: they are 
automating their own job as a way to improve their effectiveness. A consequence of this is that - unlike any time
before the 21th century - soon everyone will need to be involved in innovation: building something that has not been 
build before. If it was built before, then it's pointless to build it again, robots can do that for us.

This is a radically different society then we had before. Hierarchies break down, and orders become rudimentary: every
person becomes a decision maker. What is the single most important concept, that can drive a society like this one?
